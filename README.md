## About this
SybilEdge algorithm for fake (sybil) account detection. More detail is described in reference \[1\].

It's a practice for implement algorithm from the paper, I just test it on a small network which generate by myself. If you see any mistake in ```.py``` file, feel free to tell me :).


## Sybil Equation
Follow from two rules, 1. User's selection of target, 2. Targets' response, to detect whether the new user is sybil or not.
